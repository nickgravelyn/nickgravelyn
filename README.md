# Hi. I'm Nick.

I'm a husband, father, and human being. Sometimes I make video games with [Brushfire Games](https://brushfire.games), an indie game company I run with my brother. Sometimes I like to [make music](https://soundcloud.com/nickgravelyn). I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickgravelyn) but you can also feel free to [email me](mailto:hello@nickgravelyn.com) to say hello.
